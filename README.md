# PHL Observing Reports

This repository will contain Python and IDL programs for generating observing reports for the Planetary Habitability Laboratory's observing projects at the Arecibo Observatory.

The **Weather Reports** will generate temperature, humidity and precipitation readings for the 48-hour window surrounding a given observation date and time, from the weather station files generated at the Observatory. An example is included below.
